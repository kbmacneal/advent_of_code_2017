# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions to the advent of code challenge


# WARNING: This contains spoilers. If you don't want the solutions spoiled, only read the days you have already completed.

I tried to do every day in pure powershell, though the styles may be different day to day due to the nature of the challenge. In some folders you'll find a c# solution. Those were written in .net core 2 so they should be able to be compiled pretty much anywhere. The solution was used to verify results, and as I go back through each day and verify the solutions are working and tested I'll delete the solutions, the end result being a pure powershell repo for the 2017 puzzles.

Merry Christmas everyone, see yall next year!
